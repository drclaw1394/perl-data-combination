DESCRIPTION
    "Data::Combinations" generates hashes or arrays by making combinations
    of values for keys with array values.

EXAMPLES
            ===
            input:
            ["a","b","c"]

            outputs:
            ["a","b","c"]
        
            ===
            input:
            [["a","b","c"]]

            outputs:
            ["a"]
            ["b"]
            ["c"]

            ===
            input:
            [["a","b"], [1,2]];

            outputs:
            [a, 1]
            [a, 2]
            [b, 1]
            [b, 2]

            ===
            input:
            ["a", "b", ["x","y"], {key=>"val"}]

            outputs:
            ["a","b","x", {key=>"val"}]
            ["a","b","y", {key=>"val"}]

API
    The module only has a single function currently, which isn't exported.
    To use it it must be addressed by its full name

  combinations
            my $result=Data::Combinations::combinations $ref;

    Generates the combinations of 'fields' in $ref. A field is either a hash
    key or array index which contains a reference to an array. If a field is
    another scalar type, it is wrapped into an array of a single element.

    If $ref is a hash, the keys are preserved in the outputs, with the
    values for each key used for combination.

    If $ref is an array, the indexes are preserved in the outputs, with the
    values for each index used for combination.

    Return value is a reference to an array of combinations.

SEE ALSO
    There are other permutation modules. But they only work with flat lists?
