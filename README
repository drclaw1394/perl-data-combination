DESCRIPTION
    "Data::Combinations" is a module which generates the combinations (not
    permutations) of a hash or array which has sub arrays as elements and
    other scalars as elements.

MOTIVATION
    I wanted to make it easy to write network listener code, with difference
    combinations of interface and familiy types. That made me look for
    suitable combination code which I couldn't find. There are a few
    permutation modules, however. This is the module I wrote to generate the
    combinations which woudld then be filtered

API
    The module only has a single function currently, which isn't exported.
    To use it it must be addressed by its full name

  combinations
            my $result=Data::Combinations::Combinations $ref;

    Generates the combinations of 'fields' in $ref. A field is either a hash
    key or array index which contains a reference to an array. If a field is
    another scalar type, it is wrapped into an array

    If $ref is a hash, the keys are preserved in the outputs, with the
    values for each key used for combination.

    If $ref is an array, the indexes are preserved in the outputs, with the
    values for each index used for combination.

SEE ALSO
    There are a few permutation modules.
